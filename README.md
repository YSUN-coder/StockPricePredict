# StockPricePredict

## Introduction
The outcome (The Google Stock Price) should be continuous, so this is a regression problem.

For Regression, the way to evaluate the model performance is with a metric called RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). It is calculated as the root of the mean of the squared differences between the predictions and the real values.
